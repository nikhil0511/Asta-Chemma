Rules and regulations for playing ASTACHEMMA


The game will be played by using 8 shells as dice, by rolling them we will get different values depending on the face of the shells.
Each player will be having 8 coins(shells with different colors). The final aim of each player is to make all the coins reach the winning point i.e.,center of the board.
The one who reaches all his coins to center first will be the winner. The board has 5 levels, Player can move to 2nd level only if they kill the opponent coin at least once.
In level 4, the game changes a bit, once the coin reaches the inner squares corner they need to make pairs i.e., player cannot move his coin until it pairs with 3 more and the paired coins can be moved only with dice numbers 4, 8 and 16.
If one set of 4 coins is made, the opponent can only kill if they have same set of coins as pair.
The next 4 coins can be moved as a single coin.
Board contains safe points which are marked with "X" on the cells. When any coin reaches these safe points, opponent cannot kill the coin.
In the 5th level we have winning points ,the coins will be moved in anti-clockwise direction.
